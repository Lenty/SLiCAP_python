SLiCAP and Structured Electronics Design
========================================

SLiCAP has been developed as a tool for courses on **Structured Electronics Design**. 

Structured Electronics Design is a systems engineering approach to the design of electronic circuits. It is taught at the `TU Delft <https://analog-electronics.tudelft.nl>`_. SLiCAP is intended to derive and solve design equations of analog electronic circuits. The `Course Book <https://analog-electronics.tudelft.nl/downloads/A_Montagne_Structured_Electronics_Design_ED2_3.pdf>`_ comprises many examples of which the `source code <https://analog-electronics.tudelft.nl/downloads/SED1_5_LTSPICE_SLiCAP.zip>`_ can be downloaded. This book also presents the theory behind SLiCAP.
