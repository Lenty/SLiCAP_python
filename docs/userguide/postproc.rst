Work with the results
=====================

SLiCAP has predefined functions for plotting and generation of web pages with beautifully typeset expressions, tables, figures and files. SLiCAP also has a lot of postprocessing functions available for finding budgets for various performance parameters of electronic components, based upon the target performance specification of the circuit. There are many examples available for the design of the high-frequency behavior and the noise behavior of amplifiers.
    
It will be clear that once you have the (symbolic) matrix equation of a circuit and:

- you have sufficient knowledge of Structured Analog Design

- you are familiar with Python:

  - SLiCAP imports numpy as *np*
  - SLiCAP imports sympy as *sp*

SLiCAP can help you with setting up and solving design equations for almost any design problem. Ultimately, it facilitates the automation of design engineering.

But there is more: while doing your design work with SLiCAP, you generate a collection of linked HTML pages that document your work. This helps you to discuss your work with colleagues or present it to students, on any platform that has a browser and a network connection.
