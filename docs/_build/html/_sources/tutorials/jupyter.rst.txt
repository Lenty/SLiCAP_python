SLiCAP tutorials written in Jupyter lab
---------------------------------------

- `myFirstRCnetwork <../../../../files/examples/myFirstRCnetwork/myFirstRCnetwork.zip>`_

  This is a basic tutorial; the *Hello world* of SLiCAP.

- `MOSparams <../../../../files/examples/MOSparams/MOSparams.zip>`_

  This tutorial shows how to plot parameters against each other.

- `CSstage  <../../../../files/examples/CSstage/CSstage.zip>`_

  This tutorial discusses minimization of the noise figure of a CS stage driven from a resistive source, according to the method
  decribed in `Structured Electronic Design <https://analog-electronics.eu/Structured-Electronic-Design/structured-electronic-design.html>`_,
  Chapter 5.5.

- `FilterDesign <../../../../files/examples/FilterDesign/FilterDesign.zip>`_

  This tutorial illustrates the use of SLiCAP for designing a fourth-order Linkwitz-Reily filter using a prototype circuit and a prototype transfer function.
