=====================
Define an instruction
=====================

All the aspects of an instruction can at any time be changed from within the SLiCAP environment. An instruction can be executed if the instruction data is complete and consistent (this will be checked by SLiCAP).

In the following sections the instruction data and their default values will be discussed.

---------------	  
Simulation type
---------------

SLiCAP uses symbolic calculation methods, even if the data is numerical. If the simulation type has been set to *numeric*, parameter values are recursively substituted into the expressions for the circuit elements.

The simulation type can be set with the method **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.setSimType(*args)**.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from SLiCAP import *
    >>> prj = initProject('My first RC network') # Initialize a SLiCAP project
    >>> instr = instruction()        # Create an instance of an instruction object
    >>> instr.setCircuit('myFirstRCnetwork.cir') # Create a circuit object from the netlist 
                                     # file 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir' and make it an attribute 
                                     # *instr.circuit* of the instruction object
    No errors found for circuit: 'My first RC network' from file: 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'.

    >>> instr.setSimType('numeric')  # Set the simulation type to 'numeric'.
    >>> print(instr.simType)         # Print the current setting of the simulation type
    numeric
    >>> instr.setSimType('symbolic') # Set the simulation mode to 'symbolic'
    >>> print(instr.simType)         # Print the current setting of the simulation type
    symbolic

---------
Gain type
---------

SLiCAP can provide expressions for:

#. Nodal voltages or currents through elements that have been defined in current-controlled notation (the voltage has been defined as a function of the current).

   - gain type: *vi*

#. Transfer functions of the asymptotic-gain model:
	
   - source-to-detector transfer: gain type *gain*
		
	 This is the transfer from the source to the detector
				
   - asymptotic-gain: gain type *asymptotic*
		
	 This is the gain when the loop gain reference is replaced with a nullor.
				
   - loop gain: gain type *loopgain*
		
	 This is the transfer of the controlled source selected by the loop gain reference variable, multiplied with the transfer from the output quantity of this controlled source to its input quantity.
				
   - direct transfer: gain type *direct*
		
	 This is the transfer from source to the detector with the gain of the loop gain reference variable set to zero
				  
   - servo function: gain type *servo*
		
	 This is :math:`\frac{-L}{1-L}` in which :math:`L` is the loop gain according to the definition above.

The gain type can be defined with the method: **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.setGainType(*args)**.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from SLiCAP import *
    >>> prj = initProject('My first RC network') # Initialize a SLiCAP project
    >>> instr = instruction()           # Create an instance of an instruction object
    >>> instr.setCircuit('myFirstRCnetwork.cir') # Create a circuit from 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'
    No errors found for circuit: 'My first RC network' from file: 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'.

    >>> instr.setGainType('vi')         # Set the gain type to 'vi'.
    >>> print(instr.gainType)           # Print the current setting of the gain type
    vi
    >>> instr.setGainType('gain')       # Set the gain type to 'gain'.
    >>> print(instr.gainType)           # Print the current setting of the gain type
    gain
    >>> instr.setGainType('asymptotic') # Set the gain type to 'asymptotic'.
    >>> print(instr.gainType)           # Print the current setting of the gain type
    asymptotic
    >>> instr.setGainType('loopgain')   # Set the gain type to 'loopgain'.
    >>> print(instr.gainType)           # Print the current setting of the gain type
    loopgain
    >>> instr.setGainType('servo')      # Set the gain type to 'servo'.
    >>> print(instr.gainType)           # Print the current setting of the gain type
    servo
    >>> instr.setGainType('direct')     # Set the gain type to 'direct'.
    >>> print(instr.gainType)           # Print the current setting of the gain type
    direct

-------------
Signal source
-------------

Any independent current source or independent voltage source in the circuit can be selected as signal source. A source can be defined with the method: **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.setSource(*args)**.  The argument of the function should be the name (identifier) of an inpependent source in the circuit, or a list with the names of two sources. A list of available independent sources is returned by the method: **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.indepVars()**. 

For the analysis of balanced circuits, SLiCAP supports the definition of dual sources.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from SLiCAP import *
    >>> prj = initProject('My first RC network') # Initialize a SLiCAP project
    >>> instr = instruction()           # Create an instance of an instruction object
    >>> instr.setCircuit('myFirstRCnetwork.cir') # Create a circuit from 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'
    No errors found for circuit: 'My first RC network' from file: 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'.

    >>> print(instr.indepVars())        # Print a list with independent sources in the circuit
    ['V1']
    >>> instr.setSource('V1')           # Define the signal source
    >>> print(instr.source)             # Print the signal source
    [V1, None]

--------
Detector 
--------
	  
SLiCAP can calculate one of the following:

#. One branch current through an element defined by its V(I) relation in current-controlled notation
#. One nodal voltage
#. One branch voltage (difference between two nodal voltages)
#. One difference between two branch currents through elements defined by their V(I) relation in current-controlled notation
#. One transfer function
#. The complete network solution

For (1) - (5) this variable is defined by the detector: **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.detector** which can be set with the method: **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.setDetector(*args)** The name of this function should be composed as follows:

- In the case of a voltage detector, the name should be the concatenation of 'V\_' and the name of the output node; in general: 'V_<outputNode>'. For the voltage difference between two nodes, simply use two arguments (see example below)

- In the case of a current detector, the name should be the concatenation of 'I\_' and the name of the element (identifier) whose current is taken as detector current.

Any dependent circuit variable can be selected as detector quantity. A symbolic list with available dependent variables is returned by the method: **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.depVars()**

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from SLiCAP import *
    >>> prj = initProject('My first RC network') # Initialize a SLiCAP project
    >>> instr = instruction()           # Create an instance of an instruction object
    >>> instr.setCircuit('myFirstRCnetwork.cir') # Create a circuit from 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'
    No errors found for circuit: 'My first RC network' from file: 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'.

    >>> print(instr.depVars())          # print a list with independent sources in the circuit
    ['I_V1', 'V_0', 'V_N001', 'V_out']
    >>> instr.setDetector('V_out')      # Nodal voltage 'V_out' is detector voltage
    >>> print(instr.detector)           # Print the detecor quantity
    ['V_out', None]
    >>> instr.setDetector(['V_out', 'V_N001']) # Voltage 'V_out'-'V_N001' is the detector voltage
    >>> print(instr.detector)           # Print the detecor quantity
    ['V_out', 'V_N001']
    >>> instr.setDetector('I_V1')       # Current through 'V1' is the detector current
    >>> print(instr.detector)           # Print the detecor quantity
    ['I_V1', None]

-------------------
Loop gain reference
-------------------

The asymptotic-gain negative-feedback model uses one controlled source of the circuit as *loop gain reference variable*. The name of this controlled source is stored in the attribute: **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.lgRef**. A list with controlled sources that are available for this purpose is returned by the method:  **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.controlled()**. 

Any controlled source from this list can be assigned as loop gain reference variable. This can be done with the method **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.setLGref()**. 

For the analysis of balanced circuits, SLiCAP supports the definition of dual loop gain references.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from SLiCAP import *
    >>> prj = initProject('My first RC network') # Initialize a SLiCAP project
    >>> instr = instruction()           # Create an instance of an instruction object
    >>> instr.setCircuit('myFirstRCnetwork.cir') # Create a circuit from 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'
    No errors found for circuit: 'My first RC network' from file: 'myFirstRCnetwork.cir'.

    >>> print instr.controlled()        # Print a list with names of controlled sources
    []

----------------------
Matrix conversion type
----------------------

SLiCAP can convert the MNA equation of a network into an equivalent equation of

- A network that decribes the differential-mode behavior: *instr.convType='dd'*
- A network that decribes the differential-mode to common-mode conversion: *instr.convType='dc'*
- A network that decribes the common-mode to differential-mode conversion: *instr.convType='cd'*
- A network that decribes the common-mode behavior: *instr.convType='cc'*
- The complete network transformed to a differential-mode and common-mode base: *instr.convType='all'*

.. code-block:: python

    >>> instr.setConvType('dd')  # differential-mode equivalent network
    >>> instr.setConvType('dc')  # differential-mode to common-mode equivalent network
    >>> instr.setConvType('cd')  # common-mode to differential-mode equivalent network
    >>> instr.setConvType('cc')  # common-mode equivalent network
    >>> instr.setConvType('all') # MNA matrix transformed to differential-mode and common-mode base
    >>> instr.setConvType(None)  # MNA matrix (default)

    >>> print(instr.convType)

    None

---------
Data type
---------

SLiCAP can provide 16 types of data. The data type for the instruction is stored in the attribute **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.dataType**. It is defined by the method: **SLiCAPinstruction.instruction.setDataType**. Below an overview of the availabe data types and their meaning.
