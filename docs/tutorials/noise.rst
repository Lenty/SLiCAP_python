#. Determination of noise figures `noiseFigure.zip <../../examples/noiseFigure/noiseFigure.zip>`_

   The project file *'noiseFigures.py'* executes two python scripts:

   - noiseFigureRp.py: Symbolic calculation of a noise figure of a resistive source terminated with a resistor with flicker noise.
   - noiseFigureAmp.py: Symbolic calculation of a noise figure of an amplifier with equivalent input noise sources connected to a resistive source.
