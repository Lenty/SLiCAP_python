#. Working with balanced circuits `balancedCircuits.zip <../../examples/balancedCircuits/balancedCircuits.zip>`_

   The project file *'balancedCircuitsProject.py'* executes two python scripts:

   - balancedAmp.py: Shows you how to analysis CM and DM stability of a balanced amplifier
   - Tcircuit1.py: Shows you how to decompose a balanced network into an equaivalent DM and an equivalent CM network.
