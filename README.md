# SLiCAP: more than SYMBOLIC SPICE

## What it is
- SLiCAP is an acronym for: **S** ymbolic **Li** near **C** ircuit **A** nalysis **P** rogram
- SliCAP is a tool for **algorithm-based analog design automation**
- SLiCAP is intended for setting up and solving **design equations** of electronic circuits
- SLiCAP is a an **open source** application written in Python and maxima CAS
- SLiCAP is part of the tool set for teaching [Structured Electronics Design](https://analog-electronics.tudelft.nl) at the Delft University of Technology

## Why you should use it
- SLiCAP facilitates analog design automation
- SLiCAP speeds up the circuit engineering process
- SLiCAP makes complex symbolic math doable
- SLiCAP integrates documentation and design
- SLiCAP facilitates design education and knowledge building

## Features
- Accepts SPICE-like netlists as input
- Concurrent design and documentation
- Supports and facilitates structured analog design

## Capabilities
- Conversion of hierarchically structured SPICE netlist into a mixed symbolic/numeric matrix equation
- Symbolic and numeric noise analysis
- Symbolic and numeric noise integration over frequency
- Symbolic and numeric determination of transfer functions and polynomial coefficients of transfer functions
- Symbolic and numeric inverse Laplace Transform
- Symbolic and numeric determination of network solutions
- Accurate numeric pole-zero analysis. Symbolic pole-zero analysis for relatively simple networks
- Root-locus analysis with an arbitrarily selected circuit parameter as root locus variable
- Symbolic and numeric DC and DC variance analysis for determination of budgets for resistor tolerances, offset, and bias quantities
- Symbolic and numeric derivation and solution of design equations for bandwidh, frequency response, noise performance, dc variance, and temperature stability

## Technology
- Python, Maxima CAS, HTML, CSS, LaTeX, MathJax, Jupyter Lab

## Setting up SLiCAP
To set up SLiCAP, the following components are required:

- A Python 3 install -  Dependencies of packages is found in requirements.txt
- Maxima CAS (MSWindows: install maxima on the system drive)
- SLiCAP can generate netlists from schematics made with:
  - LTspice (MSWindows: install LTspice on the system drive)
  - gschem (MSWindows: install gschem and its netlister on the system drive)
  - lepton-eda

The dependencies are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file.

1. Download or clone the SLiCAP archive from github
2. Extract it in some directory
3. Open a terminal or an Anaconda terminal if you run python from Anaconda in the directory with setup.py
4. Enter: 'python setup.py install --user

## Project file locations
**Do not place project files in the directory where SLiCAP installs the libraries, the examples, and the documentation.**

This location defaults to: /home/yourUserName/SLiCAP/ (LINUX) or \users\yourUserName\SLiCAP\ (WINDOWS). 
  
**The contents of this directory will be overwritten if you re-install or update SLiCAP.**

## First Run
To verify setting up of SLiCAP has been done correctly, it is possible to run one of the example projects that are in the examples/ directory.

## Documentation
By default, the documentation is placed in /home/yourUserName/SLiCAP/docs/ (LINUX) or \users\yourUserName\SLiCAP\docs\ (WINDOWS). Execution of the SLiCAP command 'Help()' shows the HTML documentation in your dfefault browser.

## Contributing
This github page is to be used for contributing to SLiCAP.

### Adding features
Features should be added through pull requests and pass all checks that have been set up on the github page.
These tests include:
* Functional python tests
* Style tests verified using a linter

### Bugs
In case bugs are found, please report them to the 'Issues' page where we can resolve the issues and keep track of any possible bugs.
