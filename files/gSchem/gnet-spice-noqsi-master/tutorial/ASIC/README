This sample project demonstrates ASIC development using gEDA with openIP.

The demo assumes you have installed gnet-spice-noqsi.scm. See INSTALL in the gnet-spice-noqsi directory. You must also have ngspice installed. Typing "make" should  create netlists, run ngspice, and display a plot of the behavior of a pulse height discriminator.

Some details:

This project handles hierarchy in SPICE rather than gnetlist. Thus, there is a
gnetlistrc file containing the line '(hierarchy-traversal "disabled")'. This project uses the style of the older spice-sdb back end for gnetlist. Indeed, it works if you change the line:

GNET=gnetlist -L ../.. -g spice-noqsi

to:

GNET=gnetlist -g spice-sdb
